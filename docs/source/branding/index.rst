Palm is empowering and inclusive by design, enabling Developers and Engineers 
With diverse skill sets to create and evolve software without homogeneous programming know-how. With palm, contributors can focus on being experts in a way that generates the most value, and skip “sweating the small stuff” of rote interface memorization.
We are proud of what palm is and what it represents. These branding guidelines and associated assets are part of that representation and are intended to enhance and promote the public integrity of the project. 

In plain words, we are proud of palm, and we want these branding guidelines and assets to be used freely in an open and positive way. 

Basic Use Guidelines
================

**1.1 Capitalization**: 
    Palm is an `improper (or common) <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/common_noun#English>`_ noun, and should follow appropriate grammar rules. Most notably, palm is spelled with a capital “P” (Palm) as the first word in a sentence, and with a lowercase “p” (palm) otherwise.

Logo Usage
=========

Palm :doc:`logos` can be used anywhere palm software is incorporated or used as part of a project or workflow, referenced, compared or combined. Basically, if you are using or discussing palm software, we encourage you to use palm logos as you see fit. Palm logos cannot be used for projects or as part of media unrelated to palm - for example, please do not open a nightclub named “Palm” and use our logo. If you are unsure if your use violates these guidelines, drop us a line at data-analytics-team@palmetto.com and we will be happy to advise.
